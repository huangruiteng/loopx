"""Regression coverage for issue #4501.

An autonomous replan whose accepted semantic outcome is a coverage-backed
``no_followup`` derives ``terminal_no_followup`` from its durable writeback.
The strict terminal guard must keep rejecting new and unbound spends, but it
must not reject the remaining quota spend of the very settlement that produced
the terminal frontier.
