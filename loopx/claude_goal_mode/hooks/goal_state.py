"""Goal-mode context resolution — registry-driven, mirroring the Codex model.

LoopX's registry (``.loopx/registry.json``) is the single source of truth for the
project's goal (goal_id / agent / scope), exactly as on Codex. We resolve it by
walking up from cwd to the nearest ``.loopx/`` (or legacy ``.goal-harness/``)
registry — so two sessions in different projects are independent, and two
sessions in the SAME project share the one goal.

"Goal-mode ON / armed" for a project = a ``.claude/loop.md`` exists (written by
``/loopx <task>``). That file is the per-iteration protocol that Claude Code's
native ``/loop`` runs; its presence means loopx is driving this project. The
OPTIONAL PreToolUse hook + statusline gate on this, so they only act where loopx
is actually active. ``LOOPX_GOAL_FORCE=1`` forces armed=true for tests.
